## Prerequisites
This project was ran using a `WINx64` operating system. To replicate the environment used, download the `.txt` file located in the `requisites` folder in this repository. Running the following code will allow you to generate the same `conda env` used throughout this project.
```
conda env create -- file <file_name.txt>
```

`PyMC3` may present environmental issues. To resolve this, create a separate environment to use when constructing the Bayesian models. Running the following code will create a new environment and install `PyMC3`. Additionally, the `multilevel modeling.ipynb` notebook uses `GraphViz` to visualize the model architecture. Running `pip install graphviz` will download `GraphViz` to the respective environment. In order to visualize/generate the DOT source code, `GraphViz` must be installed to the system PATH [here](https://www.graphviz.org/)
